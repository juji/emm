**emm** is a tool to track ram usage

<!-- Also emm is the name git choose -->

## What Do You Need?

To use **emm**, make sure you're running one of these:

- **Node.js:** v18.0.0 or higher
- **Bun:** v1.0.0 or higher
- **Deno:** v1.35.0 or higher (you'll need `--allow-read`, `--allow-run`, and `--allow-env` permissions)

Cloudflare Workers support? It's in the works (pun intended).
<!-- this is also git -->

## How to Install

You can install **emm** globally or just use it on the fly. Here's how:

### Global Installation

```bash
npm install --global emm
# or
bun install --global emm
```

### Local Installation (for your project)

```bash
npm install emm
# or
bun add emm
```

### No Installation? No Problem!

Use it directly with `npx`, `bunx`, or `deno run`.

## How to Use It

Running **emm** is super simple. Just point it to your script and let it do its thing.

### Node.js (with `npx`):

```bash
npx emm <your-script.js> [options]
```

### Bun (with `bunx`):

```bash
bunx emm <your-script.ts> [options]
```

### Deno:

```bash
deno run --allow-read --allow-run --allow-env npm:emm <your-script.js> [options]
```

### Installed Globally:

```bash
emm <your-script.js> [options]
```

## Options You Can Use

- `<file>`: (Required) Path to the script you want to monitor.
- `-i, --interval <milliseconds>`: How often to check memory usage (default: 1000ms).
- `-h, --help`: Show help.
- `-v, --version`: Show version.

### Example:

```bash
npx emm ./my-heavy-script.js --interval 500
```

## Running Tests

To run all TypeScript tests:

```
npm test
```

## Programmatic API (Coming Soon)

Want to use **emm** in your code? We're working on it! Here's a sneak peek:

```typescript
import emm, { type EmmOptions } from 'emm';

// Example placeholder - actual usage might differ
// const stats = await emm('path/to/script.js', { interval: 500 });
// console.log(stats);
```

Stay tuned for updates!
